# COPPA Compliance Statement

**Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) Compliance**  
**Effective Date:** December 27, 2025

## Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Colour Me Brazil is committed to protecting the privacy and safety of children who use our platform. We fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a United States federal law designed to protect the privacy of children under 13 years of age.

## What is COPPA?

COPPA requires websites and online services directed at children under 13 to:
1. Post a clear and comprehensive privacy policy
2. Provide notice and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information
3. Give parents the choice to consent to collection and use of information
4. Provide parents access to their child's personal information
5. Give parents the opportunity to delete their child's personal information
6. Not condition a child's participation on disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary
7. Maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information

## How We Comply with COPPA

### 1. ✅ Clear Privacy Policy
We maintain a comprehensive Privacy Policy that describes:
- What information we collect from children
- How we use that information
- Our disclosure practices
- Parental rights and controls

**Access:** [Link to Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy.md)

### 2. ✅ Verifiable Parental Consent

**Before** collecting any personal information from a child under 13, we:

#### Initial Consent Process:
1. **Parent creates account** with valid email address
2. **Consent request sent** via email with unique verification link
3. **Parent reviews** our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
4. **Parent provides explicit consent** by checking consent boxes:
   - ☐ I am the parent/legal guardian
   - ☐ I consent to collection of my child's information
   - ☐ I have read the Privacy Policy
   - ☐ I understand my rights under COPPA

#### Verification Methods Used:
- **Email verification** with confirmation link
- **Payment method verification** (for premium features)
- **Government-issued ID** (for high-security requests)

#### Sliding Scale Approach:
We use appropriate verification methods based on the type and amount of information collected:
- **Low risk:** Email confirmation
- **Medium risk:** Email + SMS verification
- **High risk:** Email + payment method or ID verification
